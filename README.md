# K-nearest-neighbours

This project explores the fundamentals of the Machine Learning using K-nearest neighbours for regression analysis of the "Automobile Data Set" from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile

The aim is to predict a particular car's sale price given its features which includes information on many technical aspects of the car such as the weight of the car, mileage, acceleration, number of cylinders in the engine, horsepower, etc.

We will perform some data cleaning and then train models using a single feature for prediction and compare the results with models using multiple features for prediction. We will also examine how the performance of the algorithm depends on the value for k, the number of nearest neighbours.

The raw data can be found in "imports-85.data".
